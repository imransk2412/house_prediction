House Price Prediction using Regression

This project is focused on predicting house prices using regression techniques implemented in a Jupyter Notebook. The notebook, titled house_prediction.ipynb, walks through the process of loading a dataset, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocessing the data, training a regression model, and evaluating its performance. The overall aim is to build a machine learning model that can predict house prices based on various features of the properties.

The dataset used in this project (assumed to be named house_prices.csv) contains several attributes of houses such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, location, year built, and other relevant details. These features serve as the independent variables, while the target variable is the house price. Although the dataset file is not included in this repository, it should be placed in the same directory as the notebook for proper execution.

The notebook begins by importing the dataset and displaying basic information such as the first few records, data types, and summary statistics. This helps in understanding the structure and quality of the data. Following that, the data is cleaned and prepared for modeling, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables if needed.

A regression model—typically a Linear Regression model—is then trained using the cleaned dataset. The notebook includes steps to evaluate the model’s performance using common metrics like the R-squared score or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Based on these metrics, the model’s accuracy and predictive ability are assessed. The final step involves making predictions on new or test data using the trained model.

To run this project, you need Python installed along with libraries like pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and seaborn. You can install these dependencies using pip. Once the requirements are installed and the dataset is in place, you can launch the notebook using Jupyter and follow the steps outlined in it.

This project is intended for educational purposes and demonstrates the basic process of building a machine learning model for regression. The results may vary depending on the dataset quality and selected features. The project is open-source and available under the MIT License.
